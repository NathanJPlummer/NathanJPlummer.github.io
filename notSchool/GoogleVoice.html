   The Many Uses of Google Voice

  </h1>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   Google has failed to manage their Google Voice product.  The apps are confusing.  The service is riddled with bugs.  Google Voice keeps merging with other Google products creating brand confusion.  Worst of all Google has flubbed the marketing.  Tell people you have a Google Voice number and you’re more likely to see them scratch their head then exclaim why they love the product.  Consumers do not know what Google Voice is for.
  </p>
  <p>
   That’s unfortunate, because Google Voice is actually a fantastic and useful tool.
   <br/>
   In this guide I’ll teach you to use Google Voice to:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Create a
    <em>
     free
    </em>
    , WiFi based mobile phone service, including voicecalls, texting, and even voicemail- no cell plan needed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Make free, WiFi based, domestic calls from home and save your cell phone monthly minutes for when you’re on the go.
   </li>
   <li>
    Make cheap international calls.
   </li>
   <li>
    Make free US call when you’re traveling abroad (and send free texts, too).
   </li>
   <li>
    Minimize telemarketer calls and keep your personal number private.
   </li>
  </ol>

   A few years ago I went in on a family plan with some friends.  What sounded like a great way to save money on our monthly bill turned into a logistical nightmare when two of the plan members lost their jobs in the same month.  With charges racking up I had to turn off my cell service and started looking for alternative ways to stay connected.
  </p>
  <p>
   I quickly found out I could make calls, send and receive texts, and receive voicemails using an internet connection and a free Google Voice account.

   What you’ll need:
   <br/>
   - A microphone
   <br/>
   - Headphones (optional, but provides a better experience)
   <br/>
   - A broadband internet connection
   <br/>
   - Google Chrome (other browsers should work, but chrome has the best compatibility)
  </p>
  <p>
   To make calls you’ll need
   <a href="https://www.Google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin">
    the Google Hangouts
   </a>
   plugin.  That link will automatically detect your OS and download the appropriate plugin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once you install that plugin head to
   <a href="https://www.gmail.com">
    Gmail
   </a>
   .  Yes, Gmail.  While it would make sense for this functionality to to be available from the Google Voice page, Google has instead confusingly baked it into Gmail.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Phone Call" src="http://i.imgur.com/zCX1pDel.jpg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Click the phone icon highlighted in the bottom left corner.  A box will appear, as will your contacts.  Once you enter the number you want to call, an option will appear saying “call number.”  Click that and you should hear a ringing sound.
  </p>
  <h5 id="android-phone">

  <p>
   This used to be a very complicated process requiring a slew of hacks, but thankfully Google now officially supports this feature and it’s even simpler than using the webapp.
  </p>
  <p>
   Download the
   <a href="https://play.Google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Google.android.apps.hangoutsdialer&amp;hl=en">
    Hangouts Dialer
   </a>
   from the Google Play store.  Centered in the bottom of the app’s home screen is a little dialer icon.  Hit that and a phone dialer will show up.  From here it works just like any touch tone dialer.
  </p>
  <h4 id="text-messaging">
   Text Messaging
  </h4>
  <p>
   Here you have to make a choice.  Google Voice functionality has recently been merged into Google Hangouts.  Google has separate pages and separate apps for their Google Voice and Google Hangouts services, but it only lets you use one service at a time.  In other words, if you’re using Hangouts for your texts on your phone, you can’t switch to using the Google Voice app on your PC.  Your messages will only route to one service.  Making this more frustrating is the web app is easier to navigate using Google Voice, but the Android app for Hangouts is better designed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Confused yet?  Don’t worry, the choice is actually quite simple.  If at any point you plan to text using an Android device go the Hangouts route.  If you ONLY plan to use a web browser, go with Google Voice.

If you need to send a text, click the white box that will appear at the top of the pop-up and add a name or phone number.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note there’s also a phone icon on the Hangouts page.  This is the same app built into Gmail and if you use Hangouts you can make voicecalls from here.

  </p>
  <p>
   Once you open the app you’ll see a pretty standard text messaging interface.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Thought" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Qsicon_Achtung.svg/24px-Qsicon_Achtung.svg.png"/>
   <em>
    This next section is for people who want to manage two phone numbers, a cell number
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    a Google Voice number.  If you don’t have a cell provider and you’re using Google Voice as a free VoIP provider, open up the Hangouts app, hit “Yes” to any questions it asks, and you’re done.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s where things get tricky.  Hangouts may ask you a series of questions on how you want to use it, such as for Google Voice SMS (yes) and standard SMS (No).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hangouts was designed to combine your Google Hangouts (formerly GChat), Cell SMS, and Google Voice SMS messages.  When you send a message Hangouts uses your contact information to decide what it feels is the most appropriate and speedy message format.  If your contact is on Hangouts/Gchat the message will be sent through that service.  Otherwise it will be sent as a text message using your cell provider, and finally, if you lack cell service, as a Google Voice SMS.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is great… when it works.  Unfortunately Google can’t decide on its favored service hierarchy, and with each update you never know what parameters it’s using.  Frequently I’d send a text message from what I thought was my cell number and Hangouts would instead use my Google Voice number.  I had a lot of conversations like this:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Hey, let’s grab lunch!”
   <br/>
   “Who’s this?”
   <br/>
   “Oh, it’s Nate.  Uh, Google sent this using my Google Voice number, sorry.”
   <br/>
   “Huh?  What’s Google Voice?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Now try explaining this guide over text message.  It’s a real conversation momentum killer.  One hour later…
  </p>
  <p>
   “Yeah, okay, I don’t get it, but sure, let’s get lunch.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Trying to explain the Google Hangouts app’s pop up questions could be an article in itself.  Instead, just say “Yes” to anything it does ask and I’ll explain how to disable using Hangouts for you cellphone SMS messages.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the top left corner of the app there’s a menu icon that looks like three horizontal lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Menu" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Mobile_3bar_icon.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Click that, then choose settings, then SMS.  If the first setting setting says “SMS enabled,” hit that and then choose “disabled.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, open up your standard text messaging app to make sure it’s enabled.  If it’s not, the app will ask you if you want to make it default.
  </p>
  <p>
   From this point forward if you want to send a text using your cell phone number, use your standard text messaging app.  To send a text using your Google Voice number, use Hangouts.
  </p>
  <h4 id="voicemail">
   Voicemail
  </h4>
  <p>
   Generally, Google Voice keeps it’s voicemail  pretty close to its SMS, so if you followed the above guide, you may already know where to find your voicemails.  Just in case you need more help, I will review this.  In the meantime, you may want to change your voicemail greeting.
  </p>
  <h5 id="changing-your-voice-mail-greeting">
   Changing your voice mail greeting
  </h5>
  <p>
   For this particular section, I highly recommend finding a microphone and using the webapp.  While you can do this from the
   <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Google.android.apps.googlevoice&amp;hl=en">
    Google Voice Android Application
   </a>
   as soon as you open that app up it’s going to try to take charge of your Google Voice management and revert all your settings within the Google Hangouts app.  This is another causality of Google creating confusion with duplicated functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you feel comfortable you’ve got a good grasp on the Google Voice ecosystem and you’ll be able to revert your settings back, then this step
   <em>
    can
   </em>
   be done in the Android app without the need of a microphone.
  </p>
  <p>
   To set up your greeting using the webapp go to your
   <a href="https://www.google.com/voice">
    Google Voice homepage
   </a>
   .  Hit the gear icon in the top right corner, then choose settings.
  </p>
  <p>
   You’ll see a list of tabs above the “Google Chat” setting.  Click the second tab, “Voicemail and Text” and the very first options will allow you to record a new voice greeting.

   If you’re using only the Google Voice webapp (not Hangouts) go to your

   </a>
   and look at the left-hand pane.  Click “Voicemails”.
  </p>
  <p>
   If your setup includes Hangouts go to the
   <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">
    The Google Hangouts
   </a>
   page and click the text messaging icon.  Your voicemails will be mixed in with your text messages and they will say “New Voicemail” beneath them.

  <h3 id="part-2-save-your-monthly-minutes">
   Part 2: Save your Monthly Minutes
  </h3>
  <p>
   I have a
   <a href="https://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/other-prepaid-plans">
    cheap cell phone plan
   </a>
   that gives me loads of data and texts, but only 100 voice minutes.  By using Google Voice when I’m at home I can save heaps of minutes and use my cell provider minutes when I’m out of the house.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just follow the
   <a href="#Making Calls">
    guide above on how to make calls
   </a>
   and use the
   <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Google.android.apps.hangoutsdialer&amp;hl=en">
    Hangouts Dialer
   </a>
   app.  Viola, free (US only) calls.
  </p>
  <p>
   If this is your only interest in Google Voice you can skip the complicated text messaging setup, but I still recommend disabling call forwarding.
  </p>
  <p>
   One caveat.  Assuming you gave your contacts your cell number, incoming calls will not come in through Google Voice.  In this case, I usually just ask the person I’m talking to if I can call them back
   <em>
    on my web-phone
   </em>
   .  Avoid asking if you can call them using Google Voice unless you really want to sumarize this guide.
  </p>
  <h3 id="part-3-make-cheap-international-calls">
   Part 3: Make Cheap International Calls
  </h3>
  <p>
   Google Voice and the Hangouts Dialer app support making international calls.  My Mother lives in the Virgin Islands and this has been a godsend for keeping us connected.
  </p>
  <p>
   International calls are not free but
   <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/rates">
    the rates are generally significantly lower then your cell provider
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Google’s page does a pretty good job of explaining
   <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/141923?hl=en">
    how to buy Google Voice credits
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Once you have your credits, International Calls work exactly the same as domestic ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you give your international contacts your Google Voice number then the Hangouts app will in fact accept an incoming call- even over cellular data.  My mother has called me several times when I was not on a WiFi signal.  On a 4G network the call quality was indistinguishable from a cell call.  On a 3G network there was additonal some noise but it was acceptable and I was able to continue my conversation as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note if you have a limited data plan this feature will use your data minutes.
  </p>
  <h3 id="part-4-make-free-calls-to-the-us-when-youre-abroad">
   Part 4: Make Free Calls to the US When You’re Abroad
  </h3>
  <p>
   Last year my family took a cruise around the US and British Virgin Islands.  Calling from the boat was (no kidding) $4.95 a minute.  My then cell provider’s international rates were both confusing and probably not much less.
  </p>
  <p>
   My sister needed to call her boyfriend to arrange travel from the airport, and I suggested we find a WiFi hotspot and try Google Voice.  To our delight it worked- and did not cost me a cent.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you’re going to take your phone abroad, and I can not stress this enough,
   <strong>
    disable the cell radios on your phone.
   </strong>
   This will prevent you from accidentally making international calls or using international data, charges which can quickly escalate to the
   <a href="http://www.realcleartechnology.com/2012/04/19/how_to_get_stuck_with_a_10k_cell_phone_bill_4965.html">
    thousands of dollars
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if you’re careful to only use services while on WiFi, many apps will continually download data in the background.  Each piece of spam could be hundreds of dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
   I would also call your phone company and request a temporary service disable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even better, I would recommend a
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alcatel-OneTouch-Android-Prepaid-Tracfone/dp/B00PHRXSCS/ref=sr_1_5?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457041299&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=Alcatel+One+Touch">
    cheap, unactivated Android phone
   </a>
   Android phones will work on WiFi without cell data, acting as a sort of mini tablet.  Since your not using cellular service, the phone does not have to be compatible with your current provider.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you absolutely must bring your current phone, the process of turning off the cell radios while keeping the WiFi radio on is different for each phone, but follows the same general principle.  Put your Android phone into airplane mode, which will disable all radios.  Once you see the airplane icon, go to your WiFi settings and enable WiFi.  You should see your phones WiFi indicator pop up, but the airplane icon will also be visible.  At this point, you’ll have WiFi access while still technically using “airplane mode.”
  </p>
  <p>
   From here on out, find a WiFi hotspot and use your Google Voice services as usual.
  </p>
  <h3 id="part-5-screening-calls-with-google-voice">
   Part 5: Screening calls with Google Voice
  </h3>
  <p>
   This is less a feature and more of a social hack, but Google Voice is great for screening calls.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have several e-mail address, one personal, one professional, and one for anything I think may create spam- in other words, when I buy stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having two numbers has allowed me to create a similar hierarchy with voice calls.  Signing up for a discount card?  Give them your Google Voice number.  Buying something online?  Google Voice number.
  </p>
  <p>
   Android gives me a little prompt when a number is coming in from Google Voice.  My personal contacts have my cell information, so if I don’t recognize the incoming number (in other words, it’s not my Mother in the Virgin Islands) I don’t pick up.  If it’s really important, they’ll leave a voice mail.  ;)
  </p>
  <h3 id="using-facebook-chat">
   Using Facebook Chat
  </h3>
  <p>
   This is beyond the scope of this article, but you’ll notice the most complicated part of the Google Voice chain is the text messaging.  At this point, I’ve pretty much trained everyone to use Facebook Chat to send me messages.  It’s a shame, because when it works the Hangouts app is generally nicer, but using Facebook gives me all the same benefits of Hangouts chat without the headaches.
  </p>
  <p>
   You really only need to use the Hangouts app for texting if you’re using a WiFi only (i.e. no cell phone coverage) setup and absolutely need SMS support.  As is, I have the Hangouts Android app, but I only use it to manage the occasional voicemail.
