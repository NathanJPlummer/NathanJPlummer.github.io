  <p>
   Thanks for posting this.  And providing me with what I felt was a safe place to discuss some complex feelings I’ve been holding in.
  </p>
  <p>
   The thing is, I’ve had some experiences in this matter.  Nothing traumatizing, but more than one scenario that made me feel uncomfortable and dis-empowered for some amount of time.
  </p>
  <p>
   You know, honestly- and with no disrespect meant- this initiative has been really uncomfortable to me.  Many friends and loved ones have posted their experiences and I want to be supportive, and I also want to be part of the conversation.  I feel like I am only allowed to do so if I keep my mouth shut and don’t try to “victimize” my own experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have a lot of the same issues with how this movement is being addressed as I had with the #gotConsent movement before it- it fails to acknowledge or attempt to repair some of the really screwed up social sexual norms we have.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s the thing, the outrage over the triggering incident is justifiable, but it’s also easy.  It’s such a clean cut case.  Harvey Weinstein was in a position of power.  His actions- even just including the ones he’s admitted to- display premeditation and ill content.
  </p>
  <p>
   We should definitely be outraged at Harvey Weinstein.
  </p>
  <p>
   What I don’t understand- and I think about this daily, it really bothers me- what I don’t understand is why we are not outraged at Han Solo (or George Lucas, if you prefer).
  </p>
  <p>
   If you don’t remember the first time Han Solo and Princess Leia kiss in Star Wars let me sum it up for you.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, Han invades her personal space by sneaking up and grabbing her from behind. The fact she turns around and throws his hand off her is a pretty good indication she’s not into it.  He then reminds her “I was only trying to help” and follows that up with a slur of phrases that can accurately be paraphrased to “Hehe yeah I’m so bad and you love it baby!”  He grabs her hands and she says stop.  Instead of stopping he moves in closer.  She says stop again.  She tells him she likes “nice men.”  He kisses her despite her many protests.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can Google the scene in question if you think I’m exaggerating.  Just type “Han Kisses Leia”.  It’s easy to find.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may be thinking right now: “I have totally think that Han guy is scum” or “this is discussed on message boards all the time.”
  </p>
  <p>
   I’m sure there are many individuals who are outraged by Han and Leia, but on the whole- as a culture- we’re pretty darn okay with it.  It’s a “love” story.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, I’d argue it’s one of our most culturally recognized love stories- and it starts with a #MeToo moment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s add some context to Star Wars: It’s not “made in another time” as this is a love story that’s continued in a 2015 film.  It is also not an “embarrassing moment in history.”  We’re not locking it away like “Song of the South” and the original trilogy is very much a continued part of the cultural dialogue.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, it IS often the source of outrage.  #HanShotFirst, am I right!?
  </p>
  <p>
   But no ones screaming #LeiaToo.  I Googled it, just in case.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both #MeToo and #gotConsent have been portrayed- from the male viewpoint- as men are powerful and without remorse.  They simply can’t help themselves and if they would just learn to STOP everything would be okay.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s quote from a Salon article on #MeToo:
  </p>
  <p>
   “As well, it might — just might — help some men understand that sexual assault is not some distant phenomenon, but a regular part of the lives of the women they love. More than that, it can remind them that it’s something they often perpetuate, something only they can truly end.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Seriously, WHAT THE FUCK?!
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s forget about the oversimplifications for a moment so I can point out that I think if I was a woman I’d find that incredibly offensive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not only would I find that disempowering- only the “men folk” can fix this- but also it attempts to remove women from the discussion completely.   “We’ve said our piece, you know what to do guys!”
  </p>
  <p>
   Everything about that seems condescending.  I’m not actually a woman, so I can only hypothesize.  If I’m wrong about that, let me know, seriously.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s my real issue, though.  These movements have defined rape and/or sexual assault as women saying no while men overpower them- be it through physical, social, or professional means.
  </p>
  <p>
   That happens- far more often then we realize I suspect- but that’s not the only way sexual assault and harassment occur.  And as a result, we don’t always recognize sexual harassment: in our own behavior, or in the behavior of others.
  </p>
  <p>
   A guy in an alley is bad.  Harvey Weinstein is bad.
  </p>
  <p>
   But a a guy approaching a women, wearing a short skirt, at a bar and telling her she has great legs- that’s also sexual harassment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Or is it?
  </p>
  <p>
   I mean, I think it is.  Maybe you think it’s just flirting.
  </p>
  <p>
   What if the guy makes the comment after they’ve been chatting for 15 minutes and she’s sending “signals.”  Is it harassment then?
  </p>
  <p>
   Actually, what counts as a signal?
  </p>
  <p>
   What if a female suitor approaches a male and makes a comment on his butt?  Is THAT different?
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s acknowledge that not all sexual banter is harassment.  That often, flirting can become sexual in nature, and that’s great between two consenting adults.  In an ideal world we would have a conversation that started with:
  </p>
  <p>
   “I request permission to flirt sexually and perhaps make a comment about you legs?”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Why of course fine, sir!  Comment away.”
  </p>
  <p>
   How many of your flirty conversations actually started this way?
  </p>
  <p>
   Maybe the appropriate time is after the woman makes the first move?  Well, according to a
   <a href="http://Match.com">
    Match.com
   </a>
   survey:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Only a small percentage of single women initiate the first kiss (29 percent), initiate sex for the first time (23 percent) or ask a guy for his number (13 percent).”
  </p>
  <p>
   My own experiences and conversations with women have mirrored this: many expect men to “go first”.  What’s the line between “first move” and sexual harassment?
  </p>
  <p>
   If I DO wait for the women to make the first move, am I removing my own agency from the situation?  Am I putting too much pressure on the other party?
  </p>
  <p>
   And, you know- it’s worth pointing out I’ve only spoke about male to female heterosexual pairings.  That’s only one  dot on a spectrum of romantic and sexual interactions.  Do the rules change based on the indentites of the participants?  Am I being a hetero-normative jerkwad for asking some of these questions to begin with?
  </p>
  <p>
   If anyone actually ends up reading this novella I have found myself writing, you might be thinking you want to respond with the answers to some of those questions.  I’d love to have your opinions- I certainly have my own on the matters- but they’re just that.  Opinions.
  </p>
  <p>
   There’s no definitive answer to these questions.  I think about these things constantly and I still have no freakin idea.  The line between “making the first move” and “sexual harassment?”  I am as sure that there is one as I am I have no clue where it is.
  </p>
  <p>
   What I want, and what as a man I feel afraid to ask for, is to have open dialogues about these questions- personally, yes, but also culturally.  Nationally.  In this regard I can only relate to my personal experiences: attempts to have these discussions have resulted in me being shut down and told not to “blame the victim.”
  </p>
  <p>
   I understand that knee jerk reaction.  Blaming the victim seems to be the default defense in cases of sexual assault and harassment.
  </p>
  <p>
   So let me be clear- I am in no way suggesting ignorance resolves one of responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   I am suggesting, when you ignore the incredible complexities involved in this issue and boil the cause down to “men coercing women into sex” you create a “not me” scenario where potential perpetrators don’t question or consider their own actions, because they are not “one of them.”
  </p>
  <p>
   How many men do you think are out there right now, shaking their heads in disgust to every #MeToo post, making genuine and supportive comments- but have ALSO slapped more than one unsolicited butt in their day.  They’re no Harvey, after all, and what’s good enough for Han…
  </p>
  <p>
   This is why you have people like Ben Affleck who publicly denounced Weinstein, only for someone to point out “Hey, remember that time you totally felt up a VJ without consent?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Make no mistake, Affleck is responsible for his actions.  I am only suggesting that more nuanced discussions may prevent some of this shit to began with.
  </p>
  <p>
   And it really does not help that we have developed “mating rituals” that both encourage and value unclear messages and indirect communication.  Some men and women alike refer to it as “playing the game.”
  </p>
  <p>
   As a young adult I lost count of the number of times I was told “you’re not supposed to ask me before you kiss me.”  (And those scenarios did not ever go the way I hoped).
  </p>
  <p>
   So I came up with my own ruleset: When I wanted to kiss someone I would move in, stop about three inches away, pause for three seconds to give the other party a chance to say no, and then if there was no protest I would proceed.  I had similar techniques for anything above the waist (with longer delays as things got more heated) and if things started to go below the waist- at the point I flat out asked permission.
  </p>
  <p>
   And that was… okay, I guess?  I felt okay with it at the time, and I had more than one partner tell me they appreciated how respectful I was, but quite some time ago I looked back at those moments and thought, “Wow, that’s actually really shitty.”
  </p>
  <p>
   My behavior was shitty, and the fact this problem is so systematic that my partners actually saw this as respectful, that’s really shitty too.
  </p>
  <p>
   And what scares me is this: I grew up in households where the women outnumbered the men.  I’m the type of guy who really does not give a single fuck about gender norms.  With a few exceptions, at most points in my life I’ve had more female friends than male ones.  I have some interest in topics like gender identity, gender politics, and women studies.
  </p>
  <p>
   I’m exactly the type of guy who would ask these types of questions, frequently engage in self-reflection, and say “How can I do this better?”  I had lots of advantages and experiences that got me there.
  </p>
  <p>
   My suspicion is not only are some people not asking themselves these questions, many are not realizing they SHOULD be asking these questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   We all need to get comfortable with talking about our expectations and boundaries BEFORE we initiate physical contact.
  </p>
  <p>
   I know what Netflix is but what the hell is a “Chill.”  Is your chill the same as mine?
  </p>
  <p>
   I spoke about having had certain experiences myself.  Here’s one of them:
  </p>
  <p>
   My Sophomore year of College I had a friend I had a crush on and was very attracted to, and suspected the attraction was mutual.  We had a tendency to not be available (single) at the same time so for some time we did not acknowledge it- you could just feel there was some tension.
  </p>
  <p>
   She had ended a relationship about three weeks earlier and I had ended one about a week before.  So here we were, finally available to act!
  </p>
  <p>
   We headed to a movie with a group of friends and along the way she made a few suggestive comments.  I invited her over to my dorm to “Kazaa and Chill.”
  </p>
  <p>
   We had some friends with us at the start of the night- and some drinks.  My friend- well, she had a couple more than I did.
  </p>
  <p>
   The room had cleared out and the inevitable make out session started, but it was becoming obvious my friend was rather drunk.  Not words slurring drunk, but “impulsive drunk.”
  </p>
  <p>
   At the time, I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted from this pairing in the long term, but there was enough chemistry I saw, at the very least, romantic potential.  So I asked my friend to stop, explained I was trying to figure things out, and would prefer at least our first time not to be a sloppy drunken hookup.  I added “we can do this tomorrow if you want to.”
  </p>
  <p>
   I was greeted with agreement and appreciation- at first- but as the night went on my date became considerably more aggressive- pulling at my pants and belt.  Only stopping briefly when I protested, with time between attempts measured in minutes.  Let’s say “less than 5.”
  </p>
  <p>
   And at a certain point, I just let her do it.  I wasn’t overpowered or forced.  I could have left if I wanted to.  Truthfully, I didn’t want to.  I was enjoying her company, and I did want this happen- just not in this context.
  </p>
  <p>
   To be quite honest, in that very moment, I had no idea what I wanted.  And as I was not sure what to do I eventually thought “maybe it will be alright,” and I just let it happen.  I didn’t say yes, I just did not stop her.
  </p>
  <p>
   It WAS sort of alright in the moment.  Definitely not great, sort of alright.  The next morning I felt disappointed and kind of sad about the whole ordeal.  Not traumatized or angry, just a little bit used and unsatisfied. We stayed friends, but any feelings we had for each other just sort of evaporated after that.
  </p>
  <p>
   What exactly was that scenario and what word or words do I use to describe it?
  </p>
  <p>
   I’ve changed my mind on the answer to that question many times.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the one hand I clearly said no and never said otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, I could have stopped it without incident, and it only proceeded because I kind of wanted it to happen.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t actually need a word or a definition.  It sucks that it happened, and that is all.  I tell this story because:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    It does not involve a force or abuse of power
   </li>
   <li>
    I suspect a lot of people have stories like this and they’re often not told in the context of sexual abuse
   </li>
   <li>
    I don’t think my friend is a bad person, I think she honestly did not know any better
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   I felt sad and a little hurt by what happened.  I never felt angry.  There actually is an answer to the question “What exactly was that scenario and what word or words do I use to describe it?” and that answer is the victim gets to decide.  I certainly had the right to be angry, and anyone in a similar situation does too.  I just chose not to be.
  </p>
  <p>
   I truly think she accepted my lack of protest as consent.  As a man in his early twenties who was attracted to her, she likely assumed I “wanted it” because as a culture we have this idea that  men “always want it” and sexual harassment/abuse is a female problem.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t think she even knew to ask the question “is he okay with this?”
  </p>
  <p>
   If someone has asked her, #gotConsent, she would have likely said “hell yes I do!” and not thought anything of it.
  </p>
  <p>
   I just wish we could talk about these things and not assume every assault is some really obvious, mustache twirling event.  That sexual assaults can happen quietly, and even without actual intent. That the scenario of someone who “couldn’t or wouldn’t stop” is only one scenario.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t think the point of #MeToo is a hope we can shame men into a sort of compliance.  Those are just the voices that are shouting the loudest.
  </p>
  <p>
   I suspect most people want to point out that we have a lot of work to do to ensure everyone knows exactly what being respectful towards another human being means.
  </p>
  <p>
   I think most people just want to feel comfortable expressing their boundaries and feel with certainty the other person is listening and will comply.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yeah, I get that. #MeToo
