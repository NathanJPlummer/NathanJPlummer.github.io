            <h2>How do I Organize My Modern Developer Coursework Repository?</h2>
            <p>
                For your first few assignments assignments a Modern Developer team member will create the project folders for you. Simply follow the folder structure already put in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need further context, take a look at the
                <a href="https://github.com/moderndeveloper-students/Example-Student-Repository">Modern Developer Example Student Repository.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Take note that the Example Student Repository is a private GitHub page. You will have to be logged in to GitHub with the same account you use for Modern Developer in order to view it.

                <h2>How soon after completing a course can I expect feedback?  What type of feedback will I receive?  Can I continue on to the next course before I receive feedback?</h2>
                <h3>Feedback Priority</h3>
                <p>
                    This is an area being continually reevaluated and changed. For now this is how the feedback system works:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Completing certain courses will trigger an automatic unlock of the following course within minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other courses, which we feel will strongly benefit from feedback on previous work, will remain locked until a Modern Developer instructor has reviewed your work and deemed it satisfactory for you to move forward.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Timing is variable. We prioritize feedback on courses that require feedback before a course unlock so students do not spend more time than necessary waiting for the next course.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Requesting a Course Unlock</h3>
                <p>
                    If you’ve been able to move on to the next course then please be patient, as feedback can take up to a couple weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if you are waiting on a course unlock, and more than 48 hours have passed and you have still not received feedback, please e-mail <a href="mailto:issues@moderndeveloper.com">issues@moderndeveloper.com</a> with a quick explanation. In most cases, you’ll receive access to the next course in a few hours.
                </p>
                <h3>Feedback Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    Feedback instructors may point out some specifics, but the focus will be on general areas that could use some improvements or a different approach. Work we find to be outstanding or to show excellence will also be commented upon. Here’s an example of student feedback from the course “Introduction to CSS.”

                        Your answer for exercise 2 is incorrect, even though your logic is spot on. The stylesheet which comes at last wins, unless the styles are inline on the element. Take a look at this plunk I’ve made to demo this concept:
                        <br/>
                        <a href="https://plnkr.co/edit/XJm5eWlKyVYu7PlUTaXt?p=info">https://plnkr.co/edit/XJm5eWlKyVYu7PlUTaXt?p=info</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While your answers are good, it’d have been a lot better if you could have provided working codepen links for them. I had to take them and copy them over to jsbin/codepen to make sure everything’s working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The answers to chapter end questions are some of the best I’ve seen. I like your conversation approach in the article question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have a quirky design sense which is great on some pages such as newspaper in the exercises and the store pages. Got a few suggestion: Reduce the space around the store logo in the middle. On my macbook 13, it’s pretty much all I can see without scrolling a bit down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using texture images as background is kinda very last decade. If you’re going for some niche artistic effect, that’s great. But if not, try some other methods. As a front-end dev, you’ll need to keep up with the latest in web design and currently, it’s focused on clean and simple UX.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All your work looks great though. I look forward to your future submissions.
                    </p>

                <h3>Where to Find Your Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Feedback will be provided via your Modern Developer registered e-mail address for only the first few courses. Once we get you up to speed on GitHub, feedback will hence be given using GitHub’s “Issues” feature.

                <h2>Why does Modern Developer not unlock all student courses from the start of the program?</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn.Modern Developer doesn’t function like a Massive Open Online Course or an online course repository site where you can take any course whenever and keep chugging along. Over 94% of students do not complete such courses and programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern Developer is designed to allow you, the student, to set frequent small goals, and let your ambition be your perseverance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a specific system and we believe it is to your benefit

                <h2>Is there a Modern Developer style guide?</h2>
                <p>
                    Not yet, but there’s going to be soon- very, very soon. We’ll update this FAQ as soon as it becomes available.
