       <h2>Screening Endocrine Activity of Disinfection Byproducts</h2>
        <p class="students">Students Researchers: Paul Ebohon, MSMegan Nunes, BS</p>
        <p>Disinfection of public drinking water supplies has had a major impact on the prevention of infectious waterborne diseases but the highly reactive nature of disinfectants can be a double-edged sword. Since their discovery over 35 years ago, a body of scientific research has evolved, mostly in laboratory animals, that is suggestive of potential health effects associated with their presence in drinking water such as various cancers and adverse reproductive or developmental effects. Although the precise mode of action and specific chemical culprits remain enigmatic, there are suggestions that they might involve among others, genotoxicity and lowering of testosterone levels. The finding, for example, that male F-344 rats treated with trihalomethanes had decreased circulating concentrations of testosterone also raises the question of whether some DBPs may produce androgenic deficiency and perhaps cause endocrine disruption. As a result of amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1995, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency formed the federal Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee which recommended that DBPs be included among the mixtures evaluated for endocrine disruptive effects.</p>

        <p>Phase I of this study is designing a systematic approach for determining the most appropriate suite of in vitro ssays to definitively assess the endocrine and androgen activity of DBPs in drinking water. These methodologies include the androgen and estrogen receptor reporter gene and gene fusion assays, the latter of which include the yeast estrogen screen (YES), the estrogen receptor-mediated chemical-activated luciferase gene expression assay ( T47D-KBluc) which uses T47D breast cancer cells stably transfected with a triplet estrogen-responsive element-promoterâ€“luciferase reporter gene construct, and the stable cell line MDA-kb2 for screening androgen agonist and antagonist activity.</p>
