   Chances are you already have done this at some point, or at least know how.  If not, the process is pretty self-explanatory.  Simply follow
   <a href="https://accounts.Google.com/SignUp?service=mail&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.Google.com%2Fmail%2Fe-11-143826a5242bfe76f4b2cc1d90357eb3-d2ad6097360590d322f77c2674f403c1ca225cbf">
    this link

   to set up your own Google account.

  <p>
   Note you will need a connected phone for this, but a land-line will work fine if you don’t have cell service.
  </p>
  <p>
   After you log into
   <a href="https://www.gmail.com">
    Gmail
   </a>
   go to the
   <a href="https://www.google.com/voice">
    Google Voice
   </a>
   page.  You should see a screen much like this:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Google Voice Homepage" src="http://i.imgur.com/D3ExCQCm.jpg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Cick on the highlighted section of the left panel, “Get a Voice Number.”  Next you’ll see this:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="New Number" src="http://i.imgur.com/oW0ue7Em.jpg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Click on the section I’ve highlighted, “I want a new number.”
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    While you can technically setup Google Voice to work with your current phone number, this setup can cause glitches.  Texts not sending, or sending twice from both numbers, or incoming texts arriving hours after they were sent are just some of the issues I’ve encountered.  If you want to use Google Voice, I recommend using it as a separate phone number.  This will also allow other benefits I’ll cover in this guide.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   You should now be at the following screen:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Enter Your Number" src="http://i.imgur.com/LlIsw2Hm.jpg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Enter your phone number here.  Then click continue.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    By default Google Voice is set to work with your existing number by forwarding information sent to your Google Voice number back to your cell phone.  This, however, will lead to many of the glitches I described above.  No worries, I’ll go over how to remove number forwarding.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Another pop-up will show up with a two digit number.  Google will ask to call your phone to verify your sign up.  They’ll call the number you supplied, then use your dial pad to enter the two digit verification code.  Google will then email you your Google Voice number using the Gmail address associated with the account.

  <p>
   Head to the
   <a href="https://www.google.com/voice">
    Google  Voice
   </a>
   page and login.  You’ll be back at the Google Voice homepage.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Google Voice Settings" src="http://i.imgur.com/84v8HVCl.jpg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Once there, click on the highlighted gear icon, and then click on settings.
  </p>
  <p>
   You’ll end up here:

  </p>
  <p>
   Make sure there’s a check in the “Google Chat” box.  Uncheck the box below to disable forwarding to your current number.
  </p>
  <p>
   Congratulations, you now have a self-contained Google Voice number!
